# Deadlocks - example-1 Explanation

## Article context
This example supports the article `backend/data-storage-databases/deadlocks`. The article is about Comprehensive guide to deadlocks: circular wait conditions, wait-for graphs, detection, prevention strategies (lock ordering, short transactions), and handling deadlocks in applications.. The most relevant article sections for this example are: Deadlocks; Core Concepts: Deadlock Conditions and Detection; Coffman Conditions (All Required for Deadlock); Wait-For Graph; Deadlock vs Lock Contention; Architecture and Implementation: Prevention and Handling; Prevention Strategies; Handling Deadlocks in Application; Database-Specific Behavior; Trade-offs and Comparison: Prevention Approaches.

## What this example demonstrates
This example turns the article concept into a concrete implementation artifact. Read it as a small production-style slice rather than an isolated snippet: the files show the domain model, execution path, supporting configuration, tests or demo harness, and operational assumptions that make the article easier to apply in real systems.

## How it supports the article
The example reinforces the article by showing how the concept behaves when data moves through real boundaries: inputs are accepted, state or decisions are derived, outputs are returned, and failures are handled or surfaced. For interview preparation, connect each file back to the article sections above and explain why the implementation choices match the article's trade-offs.

## File-by-file walkthrough
- `demo.js`: Runs the main scenario and connects the supporting modules into an end-to-end flow.
- `lock-manager.js`: Implements the main logic, including locks, waitsFor, acquire, owner, release.
- `package.json`: Declares the runnable package metadata and dependencies for the example.
- `public/app.js`: Runs the main scenario and connects the supporting modules into an end-to-end flow.
- `public/index.html`: Provides supporting example content: <!-- File: public/index.html What it does: Simple UI to interact with the topic simulation. --> <!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset=.
- `public/styles.css`: Provides supporting example content: /* File: public/styles.css What it does: Minimal styling for the demo UI. */ body {{ font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 24px; color: #2.
- `README.md`: Documents how to run, inspect, or reason about the example.
- `scenario.js`: Implements the executable logic or UI behavior for the example.
- `server.js`: Implements the main logic, including http, fs, path, scenario, send.
- `simulate.js`: Implements the main logic, including sleep, runSimulation.

## Execution and data flow
Start from the app, demo, server, route, or run file when present. That entrypoint wires together the supporting modules, executes the main scenario, and prints or renders the result. Domain or model files define the entities. API, route, client, store, policy, config, or utility files express the boundaries and rules. README or notes files explain how to run or inspect the example locally.

## Important implementation behavior
- timeout and deadline handling
- pagination or cursor handling
- asynchronous or event-driven flow
- concurrency, conflict, or transaction behavior
- offline, reconnect, resume, or sync behavior
- observability and operational signals
- empty, missing, or null-state handling

## Edge cases and failure modes
- Slow dependencies need explicit timeouts and caller-visible failure semantics.
- Large result sets need stable pagination and empty-page behavior.
- Asynchronous work can arrive late, out of order, or more than once.
- Concurrent updates can race and must protect shared invariants.
- Reconnect and resume flows need conflict handling and progress recovery.
- Metrics, logs, traces, or alerts must explain production failures.
- Empty, missing, or null data should produce intentional UI or service states.
- Storage flows need clear consistency, repair, and replay behavior.

## How to use this example
Use the README if present, then inspect the entrypoint and supporting modules in order. While reading, ask: what invariant is being protected, what boundary can fail, what state can become stale or inconsistent, and what metric or assertion would prove the example works under load or failure?

## Interview value
This example is useful for mid-level, senior, staff, and principal interviews because it gives concrete language for implementation trade-offs. A strong answer should explain the happy path, the failure path, the operational signals, and the reason the design supports the article's core idea.
