# Data Replication - example-1 Explanation

## Article context
This example supports the article `backend/scalability-distributed-systems/data-replication`. The article is about Staff-level deep dive into data replication covering synchronous vs asynchronous replication, multi-primary replication, cross-region replication, conflict resolution strategies (LWW, CRDTs, version vectors), and production trade-offs for distributed data systems.. The most relevant article sections for this example are: Definition and Context; Core Concepts; Architecture and Flow; Trade-offs and Comparisons; Best Practices; Common Pitfalls; Real-world Use Cases; Common Interview Questions with Detailed Answers; Q1: In a single-leader replication system with asynchronous followers, the leader crashes after acknowledging a write but before replicating it to any follower. What happens to that write? How do you prevent this data loss?; Q2: In a multi-leader replication system, two leaders simultaneously update the same record. Leader A sets the status to "shipped" and Leader B sets it to "cancelled." How is this conflict resolved, and what are the trade-offs?.

## What this example demonstrates
This example turns the article concept into a concrete implementation artifact. Read it as a small production-style slice rather than an isolated snippet: the files show the domain model, execution path, supporting configuration, tests or demo harness, and operational assumptions that make the article easier to apply in real systems.

## How it supports the article
The example reinforces the article by showing how the concept behaves when data moves through real boundaries: inputs are accepted, state or decisions are derived, outputs are returned, and failures are handled or surfaced. For interview preparation, connect each file back to the article sections above and explain why the implementation choices match the article's trade-offs.

## File-by-file walkthrough
- `package.json`: Declares the runnable package metadata and dependencies for the example.
- `public/app.js`: Runs the main scenario and connects the supporting modules into an end-to-end flow.
- `public/index.html`: Provides supporting example content: <!-- File: public/index.html What it does: Simple UI to interact with the topic simulation. --> <!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset=.
- `public/styles.css`: Provides supporting example content: /* File: public/styles.css What it does: Minimal styling for the demo UI. */ body {{ font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 24px; color: #2.
- `README.md`: Documents how to run, inspect, or reason about the example.
- `scenario.js`: Implements the executable logic or UI behavior for the example.
- `server.js`: Implements the main logic, including http, fs, path, scenario, send.
- `simulate.js`: Implements the main logic, including scoreFromInput, runSimulation, primary, secondary.

## Execution and data flow
Start from the app, demo, server, route, or run file when present. That entrypoint wires together the supporting modules, executes the main scenario, and prints or renders the result. Domain or model files define the entities. API, route, client, store, policy, config, or utility files express the boundaries and rules. README or notes files explain how to run or inspect the example locally.

## Important implementation behavior
- pagination or cursor handling
- asynchronous or event-driven flow
- offline, reconnect, resume, or sync behavior
- observability and operational signals
- empty, missing, or null-state handling

## Edge cases and failure modes
- Large result sets need stable pagination and empty-page behavior.
- Asynchronous work can arrive late, out of order, or more than once.
- Reconnect and resume flows need conflict handling and progress recovery.
- Metrics, logs, traces, or alerts must explain production failures.
- Empty, missing, or null data should produce intentional UI or service states.
- Storage flows need clear consistency, repair, and replay behavior.

## How to use this example
Use the README if present, then inspect the entrypoint and supporting modules in order. While reading, ask: what invariant is being protected, what boundary can fail, what state can become stale or inconsistent, and what metric or assertion would prove the example works under load or failure?

## Interview value
This example is useful for mid-level, senior, staff, and principal interviews because it gives concrete language for implementation trade-offs. A strong answer should explain the happy path, the failure path, the operational signals, and the reason the design supports the article's core idea.
