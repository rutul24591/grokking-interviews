# Design a Customer Support Dashboard (Zendesk-like) - example-3 Explanation

## Article context
This example supports the article `high-level-design/other/customer-support-dashboard`. The article is about Architecture for a Zendesk-like customer support dashboard: ticket ingestion from multiple channels (email, chat, web form, API), ticket routing and assignment engine, SLA tracking with escalation, agent workspace UI, real-time collaboration on tickets, canned responses, knowledge base integration, reporting and analytics, and multi-tier support queue management.. The most relevant article sections for this example are: Problem Clarification; Requirements; Functional Requirements; Non-Functional Requirements; High-Level Architecture; Detailed Design; Channel Ingestion and Thread Matching; Routing Engine; SLA Tracking; Agent Workspace and Real-Time Collaboration.

## What this example demonstrates
This example turns the article concept into a concrete implementation artifact. Read it as a small production-style slice rather than an isolated snippet: the files show the domain model, execution path, supporting configuration, tests or demo harness, and operational assumptions that make the article easier to apply in real systems.

## How it supports the article
The example reinforces the article by showing how the concept behaves when data moves through real boundaries: inputs are accepted, state or decisions are derived, outputs are returned, and failures are handled or surfaced. For interview preparation, connect each file back to the article sections above and explain why the implementation choices match the article's trade-offs.

## File-by-file walkthrough
- `core.ts`: Implements the main logic, including note.
- `README.md`: Documents how to run, inspect, or reason about the example.

## Execution and data flow
Start from the app, demo, server, route, or run file when present. That entrypoint wires together the supporting modules, executes the main scenario, and prints or renders the result. Domain or model files define the entities. API, route, client, store, policy, config, or utility files express the boundaries and rules. README or notes files explain how to run or inspect the example locally.

## Important implementation behavior
- main happy-path behavior
- failure and boundary behavior should be inspected through the listed files

## Edge cases and failure modes
- Real-time flows need reconnect, ordering, and duplicate-message handling.

## How to use this example
Use the README if present, then inspect the entrypoint and supporting modules in order. While reading, ask: what invariant is being protected, what boundary can fail, what state can become stale or inconsistent, and what metric or assertion would prove the example works under load or failure?

## Interview value
This example is useful for mid-level, senior, staff, and principal interviews because it gives concrete language for implementation trade-offs. A strong answer should explain the happy path, the failure path, the operational signals, and the reason the design supports the article's core idea.
