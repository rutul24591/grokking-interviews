# Design a File Explorer UI - example-3 Explanation

## Article context
This example supports the article `low-level-design/component-level-ui-patterns/file-explorer-ui`. The article is about Complete LLD solution for a production-grade file explorer with thumbnails, context menus, bulk operations, search/filter, drag-and-drop, breadcrumb navigation, and accessibility.. The most relevant article sections for this example are: Problem Clarification; Requirements; Functional Requirements; Non-Functional Requirements; Edge Cases; High-Level Approach; System Design; Module Architecture; State Management; Component Interaction Flow.

## What this example demonstrates
This example turns the article concept into a concrete implementation artifact. Read it as a small production-style slice rather than an isolated snippet: the files show the domain model, execution path, supporting configuration, tests or demo harness, and operational assumptions that make the article easier to apply in real systems.

## How it supports the article
The example reinforces the article by showing how the concept behaves when data moves through real boundaries: inputs are accepted, state or decisions are derived, outputs are returned, and failures are handled or surfaced. For interview preparation, connect each file back to the article sections above and explain why the implementation choices match the article's trade-offs.

## File-by-file walkthrough
- `permission-based-rendering.ts`: Implements the main logic, including useFilePermissions, rolePermissions, userPerms, filePerms, canRead.
- `realtime-collaboration.ts`: Implements the main logic, including CollaborativeFileTree, now, operation.

## Execution and data flow
Start from the app, demo, server, route, or run file when present. That entrypoint wires together the supporting modules, executes the main scenario, and prints or renders the result. Domain or model files define the entities. API, route, client, store, policy, config, or utility files express the boundaries and rules. README or notes files explain how to run or inspect the example locally.

## Important implementation behavior
- authentication or authorization boundaries
- input validation and schema safety
- error handling and fallback behavior
- asynchronous or event-driven flow
- concurrency, conflict, or transaction behavior
- offline, reconnect, resume, or sync behavior
- empty, missing, or null-state handling

## Edge cases and failure modes
- Unauthorized or expired sessions must fail safely without leaking protected data.
- Malformed, partial, or schema-incompatible input must be rejected clearly.
- Fallback paths should preserve user trust and avoid hiding persistent failures.
- Asynchronous work can arrive late, out of order, or more than once.
- Concurrent updates can race and must protect shared invariants.
- Reconnect and resume flows need conflict handling and progress recovery.
- Empty, missing, or null data should produce intentional UI or service states.

## How to use this example
Use the README if present, then inspect the entrypoint and supporting modules in order. While reading, ask: what invariant is being protected, what boundary can fail, what state can become stale or inconsistent, and what metric or assertion would prove the example works under load or failure?

## Interview value
This example is useful for mid-level, senior, staff, and principal interviews because it gives concrete language for implementation trade-offs. A strong answer should explain the happy path, the failure path, the operational signals, and the reason the design supports the article's core idea.
